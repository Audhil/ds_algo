TCP/IP + UDP -> Internet Protocol Suite

* TCP is responsible for sending and assembling data
* TCP is reliable -> it can resend packets(retransmission of packets) if not received properly
* TCP makes 2-way connection between client & server with component[3-way handshake]
  -> client to server - sync message
  -> server to client - sync + ack
  -> client to server - ack
* TCP will take time to connect - hence it is reliable but slower
* many application level protocols, built upon TCP are
  ->  HTTP  - internet
  ->  SMTP[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol] - used for emails
  ->  WS - web sockets


UDP -> User Datagram(packet) Protocol
  ->  it is faster than TCP,
      but not reliable(some data packets may get lost),
      doesn't establish connection between client & server as like TCP,
      doesn't send data in order,
  ->  for eg., used in live streaming tv, sports, or online games
