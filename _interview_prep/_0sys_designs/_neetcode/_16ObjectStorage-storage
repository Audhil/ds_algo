Predecessor is BLOB - Binary Large OBject

Not similar to DB or file system(which has folders, files heirarchy)

it is flat way storage

for eg.,
* AWS S3 - It stores all files in flat way,
           we can see storage as folders/files structure illusion,
           all folders name are just part of the file name.
* GCS
* Azure

files stored: Imgs, Videos, database backup

we can w -> store the file
we can r -> read
we CANNOT edit / update the file - one of the trade-off

ObjectStorage [think of like a HashMaps - we'll have unique keys(names?) for each object stored in S3, we cannot have duplicates]

Usecases:
  storing large files like imgs, videos in S3 is better than storing those files in our db(it'll slow down everything).
 We can have HTTP request to get the resource from S3(Object storage).
