C - Consistent(different than ACID consistency)
A - Availability
P - Partition Tolerance -> when there is network cut off between the "leader" & "follower"

either 1 of the following is possible, not all 3 attributes possible
- CP -> when l & f are disconnected, we focus on consistency,
        it means we'll turn off all the nodes, except l.
        hence all the users will r/w from l node, which will have latest data always
- AP -> when l & f are disconnected, we focus on Availability,
        it means we'll not turn off nodes, only users connected l node will get latest data,
        whereas users connected to f nodes will get old/stale data - for eg., Twitter follower count is suitable for AP

PACELC:
  Given P, choose A or C. Else, favor Latency or Consistency.
