RDBMS - Relational DataBase Management System
major component of RDBMS is SQL - Standard Query Language

Data stored on Disk

DataStructure for RDBMS is B+ Tree
m = 3; it'll have 2(m-1) nodes, data is stored in leaf nodes in sorted order, we can query using ranges from [1 to 3] etc

           2|5
      /     |     \
    0|1 -> 3|4 -> 6|7

Create table People(
  phoneNumber int,
  name varchar(100)
);

powerful features: foreignKey constraints, joins, not null,

for eg.,
joins - select People.name, Homes.address from People, Homes where People.phone = Homes.phone;


Trade-offs of RDBMS:

A - Atomicity - [Transaction: all statements between begin & commit should execute, if anything fails in middle the whole transaction is ignored and changes are not committed]
C - Consistency - data consistency - follow the rules (Atomicity, Isolation etc)
I - Isolation - [all transactions should be serialized - one after the other, to avoid dirty reads(any transaction reads other transaction uncommitted value from db)]
D - Durability - [redis is not durable, since it is in-memory, sometimes it is DB,
                  Transaction: collection of queries - {starts with begin & ends with commit}
                  after commit is executed, all the data should be durable]
