To Reduce latency

Content Delivery Network (CDN) - caching data closer to End users, it increases reliability and availability

we can put only static content in CDN servers as of now
-Edge servers - (it's new, that allows to run code in CDN server) - out of scope of the topic

data to be cached in CDN
  -images
  -videos
  -same js that doesn't change much(apple/google/linkedIn authentication stuff)

Types:
PUSH CDN
  - for eg., when user uploads new profile pic,
  it'll reach the origin server and it is spreaded/advertised to all other CDNs around the globe,
  that can be available to users
PULL CDN
  - works similar to "write-around cache" -> user query nearest CDN, if data available it'll return immediately,
  else ping origin server retrieve, cache and share with user again
